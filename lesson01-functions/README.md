# Functions

This lesson covers the basics of **functions and recursion**.

There is also a small extension section discussing functional programming for the interested (if not in the session, those exercises will require a bit of research in order to solve :) )!

This directory is organised into slides, exercises and solutions.

Note: Solutions and slides will be shared _after_ the session.

### How to run code

Exercises 1-4 will run on any machine with Python >= 3.7. No extra packages are required.

Should you wish to run the code online instead, this [Python online IDE](https://www.online-python.com/) can be used.

### Functional programming extension

The functional programming extension is a bit more advanced and will require some research to solve. It is not required for the session, but if you are interested in functional programming, it is a good exercise to try as it will increase your understanding of recursion.

Try to complete them using only immutable constructs (i.e. vals and not vars) and recursion.

These exercises are in lesson01-ex05.scala and can be run using the [Scala online IDE](https://scastie.scala-lang.org/) or any Scala IDE of your choice.
